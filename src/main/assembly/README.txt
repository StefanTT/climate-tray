Climate-Tray 
============

Version: ${project.version}
Build timestamp: ${timestamp}

Climate-Tray is an application to control Mitsubishi Cooling & Heating units.
It is designed to run as tray-icon showing the current state of a device
and manipulating the state of one or more units by configurable presets.

Currently only some Mitsubishi products are supported (especially the 
one I have access to), but the application can easily be extended.
